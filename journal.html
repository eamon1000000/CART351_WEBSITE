	<h4> WEEK 1: SEPT 8th </h4>
	<article>The first class introduced us to the course structure and expectations. We went through the syllabus covering all projects, tools, and materials for the semester. We also covered fundamental web concepts: how pages are requested, accessed, and how data is displayed to users through various server requests.</article>

	<h4> WEEK 2: SEPT 15th </h4>
	<article>This week we learned some Python fundamentals, which I had done before, but not in a while, so it was nice to get a refresher on the basics. We installed Python and Miniconda, and began working with these. The comparison of python to JavaScript was really helpful to understand its use in a web dev context.

	<h4> WEEK 3: SEPT 22nd </h4>
	<article>We learned how to manage Python dictionaries, lists, and looping. We also delved into web APIs which is always a fun exercise. We worked with a basic weather API, then completed Exercise 1 using the World Air Quality Index API to parse and output different information.

	<article>This week we viewed other students' Project 02 submissions and wrote responses. It was really fun to see other students' projects and was helpful to ask about how other people implemented specific features. It was great for gathering inspiration as well.
